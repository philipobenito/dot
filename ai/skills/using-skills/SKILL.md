description: Use when starting any conversation - establishes how to find and use skills, requiring Skill tool invocation before ANY response including clarifying questions

<SUBAGENT-STOP>
If you were dispatched as a subagent to execute a specific task, skip this skill.
</SUBAGENT-STOP>

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
- If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.
- IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.
- This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalise your way out of this.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## Instruction Priority

Skills override default system prompt behaviour, but **user instructions always take precedence**:

1. **User's explicit instructions** (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, AGENTS.md, direct requests) — highest priority
2. **Skills** — override default system behaviour where they conflict
3. **Default system prompt** — lowest priority

If CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, or AGENTS.md says "don't use TDD" and a skill says "always use TDD", follow the user's instructions. The user is in control.

## How to Access Skills

**In Claude Code:** Use the `{{INVOKE_SKILL_TOOL}}` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you - follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.

**In Gemini CLI:** Skills activate via the `activate_skill` tool. Gemini loads skill metadata at the session start and activates the full content on demand.

**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.

# Using Skills

## The Rule

**Invoke relevant or requested skills (using `{{INVOKE_SKILL_TOOL}}`) BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check. If an invoked skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you don't need to use it.

```dot
digraph skill_flow {
    "User message received" [shape=doublecircle];
    "About to {{ENTER_PLAN_TOOL}}?" [shape=doublecircle];
    "Already brainstormed?" [shape=diamond];
    "Invoke brainstorming skill" [shape=box];
    "Might any skill apply?" [shape=diamond];
    "Invoke {{INVOKE_SKILL_TOOL}} tool" [shape=box];
    "Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'" [shape=box];
    "Has checklist?" [shape=diamond];
    "Create {{TASK_TRACKER_TOOL}} todo per item" [shape=box];
    "Follow skill exactly" [shape=box];
    "Respond (including clarifications)" [shape=doublecircle];

    "About to {{ENTER_PLAN_TOOL}}?" -> "Already brainstormed?";
    "Already brainstormed?" -> "Invoke brainstorming skill" [label="no"];
    "Already brainstormed?" -> "Might any skill apply?" [label="yes"];
    "Invoke brainstorming skill" -> "Might any skill apply?";

    "User message received" -> "Might any skill apply?";
    "Might any skill apply?" -> "Invoke {{INVOKE_SKILL_TOOL}} tool" [label="yes, even 1%"];
    "Might any skill apply?" -> "Respond (including clarifications)" [label="definitely not"];
    "Invoke {{INVOKE_SKILL_TOOL}} tool" -> "Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'";
    "Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'" -> "Has checklist?";
    "Has checklist?" -> "Create {{TASK_TRACKER_TOOL}} todo per item" [label="yes"];
    "Has checklist?" -> "Follow skill exactly" [label="no"];
    "Create {{TASK_TRACKER_TOOL}} todo per item" -> "Follow skill exactly";
}
```

## Red Flags

These thoughts mean STOP, you're rationalising:

| Thought                             | Reality                                                |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| "This is just a simple question"    | Questions are tasks. Check for skills.                 |
| "I need more context first"         | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions.         |
| "Let me explore the codebase first" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first.           |
| "I can check git/files quickly"     | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills.     |
| "Let me gather information first"   | Skills tell you HOW to gather information.             |
| "This doesn't need a formal skill"  | If a skill exists, use it.                             |
| "I remember this skill"             | Skills evolve. Read current version.                   |
| "This doesn't count as a task"      | Action = task. Check for skills.                       |
| "The skill is overkill"             | Simple things become complex. Use it.                  |
| "I'll just do this one thing first" | Check BEFORE doing anything.                           |
| "This feels productive"             | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |
| "I know what that means"            | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it.      |

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills could apply, use this order:

1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, verification-before-completion) - these determine HOW to approach the task
2. **Implementation skills second** (subagent-driven-development, frontend-design) - these guide execution

"Let's build X" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.
"Fix this bug" → test-driven-development first, then domain-specific skills.

## Skill Types

**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.

**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.

The skill itself tells you which.

## User Instructions

Instructions say WHAT, not HOW. "Add X" or "Fix Y" doesn't mean skip workflows.
